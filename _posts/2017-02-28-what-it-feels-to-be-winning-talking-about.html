Talking about underrated songs, Good Drank stands up there. The easy listening track, produced by the pioneer Mike Dean for an Atlanta all star reunion of 2 Chainz, Gucci Mane and Quavo, wasn’t the strip-club banger everybody expected. Instead, it offered the smoothest possible soundtrack for a trip to the South, warm like a ray of sunshine on your drowsy face.<p>Forget the idea that pain and self-destructive behaviors are keys to inspiration. The heartful performance given yesterday by 2 Chainz and Gucci, with Mike Dean on the piano, and a classy choir replacing Quavo, proves it. Sometimes it just feels good to be winning.  </p><p>Because, despite of all efforts, Moonlight did get the oscar in the end.</p>
