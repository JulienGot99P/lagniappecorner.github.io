<p>Chief Keef may have disappeared
from the mainstream, but he remains a prolific and versatile artist. He recently
released a surprisingly radio-friendly banger. The dancehall vibe could look like a
rehash of the current caribbean trend, but let’s face it, Sosa just does it better.</p><p>With this song, he tries to
convince a crush he’s worthy of her trust. I extracted 5 lines that prove Keef is a natural poet and a model lover.</p><p><b>LINE 1</b></p><blockquote><p><i>“Girl
you look fine like wine”</i> </p></blockquote><p>The ultimate compliment. A good wine is a complex, rare thing. It’s a
matter of balance between acidity and sweetness. It’s a ballet of deep, rounded and
intricate flavors. And it gets better with age. <br/></p><p>

<b>LINE 2</b>

<br/></p><blockquote><p>















<i>“Baby I
respect you and love you if you let me I do not take you as a dumb dumb”</i> <br/></p></blockquote><p>Chief Keef is not the regular frustrated guy, 

looking for an eye candy. He also desires a partner to share ideas and opinions, being aware that a healthy relation is based on physical and intellectual attraction.  </p><p>

<b>LINE 3</b>

<br/></p><blockquote><p><i>“I&rsquo;ll wear you out like my Louie</i></p><p><i>Squeeze on you like my tooly</i></p><p><i>Stir you up like a smoothie</i></p><p><i>Clean you up like my jewelry”</i></p></blockquote><p>Here, the conjunction of
prosaic images is explicit, in every acceptions. It’s disturbing, but hey, love makes you do weird shit sometimes.<br/></p><p><b>LINE 4</b></p><blockquote><p><i>“I just picked you up some Roses in the lotus”</i></p></blockquote><p>According to Buddhists, the rose lotus, also called Nelumbo, is a sacred flower that represents purity and devotion. And Lotus is also a sports cars brand, which means the girl will get romantism *and* adventure. <br/></p><p><b>LINE 5</b></p><blockquote><p><i>“But they be still tryna fuck with me</i></p><p><i>When it comes to them I act like I&rsquo;m rusty”</i></p></blockquote><p>Glory Boy assures that he’s willing to make the big jump into monogamy. To avoid betraying his soulmate, he’s even willing to fake impotence. That’s how far he’s ready to go. </p><hr><p><b>BONUS</b></p><p>Chief Keef recently exhumed an old collaboration with Gucci Mane. As expected the result is a weird, messy, boiling trap anthem. Just the right energy for your morning subway ride.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBVGFbAmLf2M"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVGFbAmLf2M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>
