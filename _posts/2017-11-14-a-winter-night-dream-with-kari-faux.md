<p align="justify">Secluded at the borders of the 19th district of Paris, the neighborhood of Curial Cambrai is stuck between the train tracks that run north of the city and the canal Saint Denis. At the foot of this jungle of tall project towers, folks can find some good time inside the Espace B, a rustic “café concert” where the locals and a population from the gentrified areas nearby meet at night.</p>
<p align="justify">On this particular evening of November, the regular customers had the chance to sip on their beer in the company of an enchanting crowd, made of pretty girls in high boots, colorful braids, and garish fur coats. Those girls, and secondarily me, gathered there to see <b>Kari Faux</b>, one of the last female rappers to make a sensation among insiders. She was recently brought to light by the soundtrack of the TV show <i>Insecure</i>, and even though her exposition didn’t blow up yet, the rapper already managed to build a solid fanbase on the internet.</p>
<p align="justify">In the backroom of the bar, where the concert was about to happen, the crowd was scattered but excited to welcome Kari for her first time in Paris. The french rapper <b>Kwezi Kimosi</b>, who recently appeared on the mixtape <a href="https://callmefemcee.com/" target="_blank">Call Me Femcee</a>, opened the show and pulled me out of my reverie. She immediately set the tone for the evening, connecting with the audience with songs paying tributes to women struggles and lyrics encouraging men to do better. I slowly let myself transported, feeling like Steve Trevor on the island of Themyscira : a guest in a special land ruled by and for women. Yes, this was a Wonder Woman reference.</p>
<p align="justify">As soon as the opening act ended, the most daring girls in the audience climbed on stage to improvise an uproaring dance party. The temperature rose while they fooled and twerked around, when suddenly, at the center of their dance circle, Kari appeared, as if the amazons had summoned their queen. In the magical world of Rap Game Daria (Kari’s alter ego), fairy creatures wear oversized sweaters, crop tops, denim trousers, bomber jackets, and do what the fuck they want.</p>

<p align="justify">Kari shined for the next sixty minutes on stage, quickly throwing away her black boots, coat and sweater under the cheers of the public. Dancing barefoot and gracefully waving her tattooed arms, she could pass off as a badass version of a naiad. The audience was hooked by the catchy lyrics, heavy bass and incisive beats of her “internet rap”.</p>
<p align="justify">The show eventually reached an end in a complete anarchy, with many girls joining Kari onstage to repeat the improvised circle dance that opened the show. A perfect conclusion to get us ready to face again the cold night outside.</p>
