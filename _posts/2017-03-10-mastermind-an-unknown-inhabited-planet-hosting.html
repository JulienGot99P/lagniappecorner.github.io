An unknown, inhabited planet hosting the memory of a lost civilization. A starry sky, enchanting gate to another dimension. The
setting of <b>The Weeknd</b>’s last clip is a pure tribute to 80’s science fiction. No
wonder, considering Daft Punk is featured on the single.<br/></p><p>5 years ago, to the day, <b>Jean Giraud</b> passed away. The
comic book artist, also known as <b>Moebius</b>, left behind a collection of
masterpieces (<b>l’Incal</b>, <b>Arzach</b>) that defined the iconography used in the video. </p><p>Not only was Moebius a genius of comic books, but his contribution to the big screen, as screenwriter and designer, is enormous. In 1981, coming out of his work on <i>Alien, </i>he designed the unforgettable set and costumes for the movie <i>Tron </i>: 30 years later, Daft Punk will produce a thrilling soundtrack for the (poor) remake.  </p><p>

To celebrate the mastermind, I listed below three
movies that every starboy should watch. </p><hr><h2><b>The Time Masters (1982)</b></h2><p>A film directed by <b>René Laloux</b> and designed by Mœbius.
It’s the story of a young boy, lost on a desert planet full of giant hornets, and the journey of the space pilot
Jaffar to save him. It’s charming and disturbing at the same time : everything an animation movie should be.    </p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="459" data-orig-height="344" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFKBdeb6dmXI"><iframe width="540" height="405" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FKBdeb6dmXI?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><hr><h2><b>Heavy Metal (1981)</b></h2><p>Moebius was famous for his work in the French cult magazine <i>Metal Hurlant</i>, first issued in 1975 (the magazine later got an American edition, <i>Heavy
Metal</i>).</p><p>In 1981, <i>Heavy Metal : The Movie</i> gathered a collection
of short-stories influenced by the magazine. Even if Moebius wasn’t involved in the
production, the last story <i>Taarna</i> is directly inspired by his comic book
Arzach. The result is flawed, but has a unique madness.  </p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="459" data-orig-height="344" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DaCWg50TKqb4"><iframe width="540" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCWg50TKqb4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><hr><h2><b>Jordorowski’s Dune (2013)</b></h2><p>It was a legend going on the internet. The tale of a
time when Star Wars didn’t even exist yet : a team of brilliant minds once tried to adapt
on screen the greatest book of science fiction, <b>Frank Herbert</b>’s <i>Dune</i>. <b>Jodorowsky</b>,
<b>H.R. Giger</b>, <b>Moebius</b>, <b>Chris
Foss</b> and <b>Dan O’bannon</b> were about to make the paradigm of all sci-fi movies, but Hollywood studios junked it up. The movie never came on screen, but its legacy changed the
face of cinema.<br/></p><p>

<i>Jordorowski’s Dune</i> is the documentary that explores why the disaster was in reality a miracle.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dm0cJNR8HEw0"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0cJNR8HEw0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>
