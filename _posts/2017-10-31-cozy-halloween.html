<p align="justify">It's Halloween night my friends, and for the real weirdos out there who will stay at home instead of getting wasted in a random party between a slutty Harley Quinn and a frat bro who still thinks it's hilarious to crossdress, I gathered on a playlist a selection of spooky videos, movies and albums. And it works any time of the year.</p> 

<ul>
  <li><b>21 Savage</b>'s world is raw and violent. Rather than going against the puritans who accuse rap of corrupting the youth, he turned his video for "All the Smoke" into an authentic teen slasher.</li>
  <li><i>Mind Playing Tricks On Me</i>, is often cited as one of the greatest songs of hip-hop. <b>Scarface</b> wrote it at the age of 19, after a depression that forced him to spend some time in a mental hospital.</li>
  <li>In <b>John Carpenter</b>'s movie <i>They Live</i>, a workman goes on a rampage after finding glasses that unveil an intergalactic conspiracy underlying capitalism. A powerful movie that needs to be saved from neo-nazis.</li>
  <li><b>George Romero</b>'s <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> gave rise to the modern zombie. The movie made a powerful statement by casting a black male as main character.</li>
  <li><i>Underground Vol. 1</i> is a remastered compilation of early works of the <b>Three 6 Mafia</b>, and the proof that Memphis horrorcore's masters (and Oscar awarded) certainly made a deal with the devil to keep their music ageless. RIP Lord Infamous.</li>
  <li>Japanese horror manga artist <b>Junji Ito</b> knows a lot about fear : he use to be a dental technician. His short story <i>The Enigma of Amigara Fault</i> is a fucked up tale of human loneliness and social conformity.</li>
  <li><i>P.T.</i> is a video-game that will never exist. Expected to be the paragon of horror games, the collaboration between <b>Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro</b> was quickly cancelled. Only remains a demo that probably reshaped gaming dramatization.</li>
  <li><b>Tommy Wright III</b> is another Memphis OG. His music is so lo-fi, so dark and so underground that it feels like listening to a ghost. His 4th album <i>On The Run</i>, is the straightforward picture of an American nightmare.</li>
  <li>In 1816, <b>Mary Shelley</b> and a few friends went for a summer stay on the banks of Lake Geneva. While a powerful electrical storms stuck them inside (it would be recalled as the year without a summer), the party spent days making up scary stories. One night, Mary dreamed of a mad scientist and its creature, "the hideous phantasm of a man". Two years after, she published <i>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</i>, and therefore invented science-fiction.  </li>
</ul>
