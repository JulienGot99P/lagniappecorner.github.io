<p align="justify">In his book <i>Social withdrawal–Adolescence without End</i>, the Japanese psychologist Tamaki Saitō (斎藤 環), specialized in adolescence, studied the concept of <i>hikikomoris</i>. 
Compared to modern hermits, <i>hikikomoris</i> are young adults who decide to withdraw from social world, sometimes spending years without leaving their apartment.</p>

<p align="justify">No movie better depicted the identity crisis underlying this phenomenon than the master piece anime <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>. It tells the story of Major Motoko Kusanagi’s hunt for a mysterious terrorist 
called the Puppet Master, who turns out to be an artificial intelligence spreading into the internet. The movie was brought to prominence by its ending : while the spectator expects Kusanagi to defeat the AI and protect the social order, things take a turn. The Puppet Master convinces Kusanagi of her limitations, pushing her to abandon her physical shell to join him cyberspace. 
Like hikikomoris, Kusanagi chooses to leave the miseries of human society. Like them, she projects herself in a larger and more fascinating world : the internet.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Sybyr (formerly know as Syringe)</b>, young and mysterious underground icon of the dark trap wave, may be a <i>hikikomori</i>. He might as well be Kusanagi’s and the Puppet Master’s progeny. In all cases, his music will plug you in for 
a trip under acid through the global data network. The mere existence of Syringe remains an internet maze of dead links and multiples aliases. Sometimes he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/6gg1kq/syringe_has_gone_missing/">vanishes</a>, forcing his friends to call for help on social medias. Other times he exposes himself, on <a href="http://weirdclvn.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> or Youtube. 
His last work <i>Anti-World</i> doesn’t really help the listener to unveil the true identity of this kid with a voice beyond the grave. But if Tamaki Saito wanted to dissect a teenage brain, it would be a challenge to find a better subject.</p>
