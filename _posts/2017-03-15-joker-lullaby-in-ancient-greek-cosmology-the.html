<p align="justify">In ancient Greek cosmology, the universe was conceptualized as an orderly system, where
every existing thing was just right in place, with Earth it its center. The
world of <b>DC Comics</b> is different: it’s a big mess where infinite Earths coexist
in one physical space, separated by differing vibrations, and frequently rebooted by cosmological crisis. Connoisseurs refer to
this as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-DC-multiverse">Multiverse</a></p>.
<p align="justify">Among the Multiverse, each
Earth has its unique rules and specificities. In one of them <b>Superman</b> is a
villain. In another <b>Bruce Wayne</b> parents are still alive. In another last, all
superheroes are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dccomics.com/characters/earth-47">actual hippies</a>.   </p><p>After watching <b>Kodak Black</b>’s video for the single <i>Too Many Years</i>, one idea struck me.
What if our Earth was the one where <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(comics)">the <b>Joker</b></a> is a young
boy from Florida, trying to wipe his personality disorders through rap music? With
the help of <b>PNB Rock</b>, he attempts to overcome prejudices, and proves it ain’t that
easy to be a supervillain.</p>
<p align="justify">One question remains: on this Earth, who is Batman?</p>
