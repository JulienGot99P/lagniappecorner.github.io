<p align="justify">In 2009, <b>Jay Z</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.O.A._(Death_of_Auto-Tune)">predicted the death of auto-tune,</a> upsetting its self-proclaimed king, the Floridian <b>T-Pain</b>. Almost 10 years after, T Pain’s career collapsed, but his creature conquered rap music.</p>
<p align="justify">The popularization of Auto-Tune will be remember in the history of hip-hop as a major schism. Rarely an instrument divided the audience so completely. For many, the audio processor popularized by <b>Cher </b>and <b>Daft Punk</b> will always appear like a murder weapon, that helped merging rap and pop music, and dig the grave of R&amp;B singers.<p>
<p align="justify">The despised instrument now resonates in every night club around the globe. A consecration for which T-Payne may not have received the merit he deserves.</p>
<p align="justify">Trying to revive his career, and apparently tired of sitting on his never-released collaboration with <b>Lil Wayne</b>, T-Pain followed the zeitgeist : he just dropped the thing for free on his soundcloud. It comes straight from 2009, when both of them where at the top of their game. Archaeological.</p>
