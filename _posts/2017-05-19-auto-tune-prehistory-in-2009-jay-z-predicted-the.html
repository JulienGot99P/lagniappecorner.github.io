<p>In 2009, <b>Jay Z</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.O.A._(Death_of_Auto-Tune)">predicted the death of auto-tune,</a> upsetting its self-proclaimed king, the Floridian <b>T-Pain</b>. Almost 10 years after, T Pain’s career collapsed, but his creature conquered rap music.</p><p>The popularization of Auto-Tune will be remember in history of hip-hop as a major schism. Rarely an instrument divided the audience so completely. The audio processor popularized by <b>Cher </b>and <b>Daft Punk</b> helped merging rap and pop music (and therefore digging the grave of R&amp;B singers), but will always be looked down upon as a murder weapon by some.
</p><p>Apparently tired of sitting on his never-released collaboration with <b>Lil Wayne</b>, T-Pain followed the zeitgeist : he just dropped the thing for free on his SoundCloud. It comes straight from 2009, when both of them where at the top of their game. Archaeological.  <br/></p>
