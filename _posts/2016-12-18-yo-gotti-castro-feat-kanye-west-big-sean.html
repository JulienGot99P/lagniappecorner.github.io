<p>2016 is almost over, and we all feel like saying “fuck it”.</p><p>Hopefully, <b>Yo Gotti</b> decided to give us a treat by reuniting on <i><b>Castro</b></i> the 

almost entire Rat Pack of the year, allowing us to wave our middle finger one last time at all the moralizers of the world while lightning a Habano.</p><p><b>Ben Billions</b> on the production proves he is one of the hottest soundmakers of the moment. While pretty discreet, the guy already has an impressive resume. Regularly collaborating with The Weeknd, he is featured on several (and the best) tracks of <i>Starboy.</i> This year only, he worked with Beyonce on <i>Lemonade</i>, he was behind Yo Gotti’s last hit <i>Down in the DM</i>, and he arranged the hottest collab of 2016 with 

 Future &amp; The Weeknd’s <i>Low Life</i>. His work always shines by creating loud atmospheres that make you wander and explore new details with each listening.</p><p>The track is also another great opportunity to realize how Quavo and 

2 Chainz have been killing verses through the whole year.     <br/></p><p>Yo Gotti’s new mixtape, <i><b>CM9 (<i>White Friday)</i></b>,</i> is expected on 23th of December. Until then, you should check his last album <i>The Art of Hustle,</i> which has been one the most slept on projects of 2016. It certainly lacks coherence, but has that obssessive, immersive and classical Memphis soul.
