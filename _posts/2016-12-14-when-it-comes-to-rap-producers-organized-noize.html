<p> When it comes to rap producers, Organized Noize might not be very familiar to a broad audience. The names of 
Rico Wade, Ray Murray and Sleepy Brown don&rsquo;t resonate like the ones of Dr Dre, Timbaland or Dj Premier. Yet, it would not be exagerated to consider the Atlanta-based trio

 among the most impactfull producers of rap history. When 2 Chainz tells you they put the south on the map, you have to believe the guy. They brought that fish and grits sound to another level, switching sampled music for live instruments. Creating the biggest rap band of all time, namely Outkast. Forging a vibe that would take over the world of hip hop and, subsequently, pop music. Opening the path to major producers such as the grammy nominated Mike Will Made It (the guy behind Beyonce’s “Formation”), or the “next big thing” Metro Boomin. </p><p><br/>All of this is very well explained in the documentary “The Art of Organized Noize”, that has been out on Netflix for a few months now. A must watch for music fans. <br/><br/></p><p>The best part of this movie resides without a doubt in its first hour, depicting the life of young children of South East Atlanta, passionate with music and business, portraying the charismatic figure of their leader Rico Wade, and the creation of the Dungeon Family in his mother’s basement. </p><p><br/>If the movie then looks like a more formal glorification of the work of Organized Noize, it also manages to give an honest and touching statement on their failures and legacy. Rico Wade sounds truly poignant while defending his (poor) business decision of privileging the equity among the Dungeon Family onto a better share deal for the team of songwriters/producers.</p><p><br/>The documentary also includes true wtf moments starring the always very appreciated Diddy.<br/><br/></p><p>In a few words : praise onto you Mrs Wade for opening the gates of your basement to the Dungeon !
