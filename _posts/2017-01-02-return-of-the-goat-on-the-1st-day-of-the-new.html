<p>On the 1st day of the new year, Antwan Andre Patton better known as <b>Big Boi</b> changed his profile picture to a <b>Outkast</b> logo, giving hope to the hord of believers that have been praying to see the duo be reunited again.</p>

<p>Few month earlier <b>Gucci Mane </b>broke the internet go crazy by revealing he worked on an Outkast song. The excitement was deceived soon after, when Big Boi explained the track was for his next solo album.</p>

<p>But when you think about it, <b>André 3000</b> has been musically more productive in 2016 than ever in a recent time. It started with a ghost appearence on Kanye West’s <i>30 Hours</i>, followed by a collaboration to A Tribe Called Quest’s posterity with <i>Kids</i>, to end with a glorious hook on Kid Cudi’s <i>By Design</i>. The circle seems complete.</p>

<p>What if all 2016 was just a slow and invisible set up for the return of the greatest rap band of history ?</p><p>Mark my words.</p>
