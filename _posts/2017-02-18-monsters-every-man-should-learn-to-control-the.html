<p>Every man needs to learn to control the monster inside of him. Kodak Black, unfortunately, still has a long road ahead before reaching inner peace. Mixed up in a serious legal affair far from being over, the young man’s recent attitude shows a constant struggle between relapse and redemption. ‘’I’m too hood’’ he once said, half resigned. </p><p> <a href= "https://youtu.be/2Uy3uLIGRnA" target="_blank">The World's A Masquerade</a> once sang <b> Earth Wind & Fire </b>. It’s never easy to separate the right from the wrong, But young black men are usually the firsts to pay the cost.</p><p>In his powerful last video, Kodak and his friends take part in an inverted rite of exorcism. Under the stars, the three little demons dance in front of shattered symbols of counterfeit virtue. By embrassing the darkness, they aim to purge Trump’s America off the seeds of hate.</p><p>It’s no redemption, but it’s life-saving.</p>
