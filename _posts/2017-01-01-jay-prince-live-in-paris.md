<p align="justify">The bright red carpet of the lobby was contrasting with the cold night outside. Walls were trembling with the loud bass reasonating from behind the swing door. 
<b>The New morning</b>, a jazz club in the 10th district of Paris, surely looked like it was about to fall appart, 
but it had that ageless charm appreciated by the hipster inside of me.</p>

<p align="justify">My girlfriend and I showed our
tickets and, a few minutes later, settled ourselves in front of
the stage, while sipping respectively a Martini and a bottled Heineken.
Onstage, <b>Jay Prince</b> was energetically shaking a head full of
dreadlocks, in a tropical scenary that achieved to make us forget about the
winter.</p>

<p align="justify">The London born rapper was in
Paris to perform his last album <i>Smile Good, </i>and confirm
the little hype starting to build around him. Jay Prince is the typical
multi-talented rapper : MC, singer, musician. His ease allows him to stay
natural, and fully interact with an audience charmed by his skills and
enthusiasm (and incidentely give a lesson to all rappers using pre-recorded
vocals).</p>

<p align="justify">Jay Prince refers to his own
style as mellow nostalgic Hip-Hop, but it really doesn’t feel
outdated. It blooms in a live show, with just the right balance between
contemporary trap beats and a more timeless jazzy vibe.</p>

<p>Definitely a 2017 watch-on.</p>
