<p style="text-align: justify;">The rap galaxy was definitely busy this week. With <strong>Meek Mill </strong>still in jail, many supporters including <strong>Rick Ross</strong> gathered to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/11/15/564385830/meek-mill-sentencing-protest-probation-parole-reform" target="_blank">protest for a necessary reform of the probation and parole system</a>. Meanwhile, the <strong>XXXTentacion</strong>&rsquo;s show continued, as he fired (so to speak) shots at <strong>Migos</strong> for jumping on him, before backing out of his version of events. And of course, we sadly learned that <strong>Lil Peep</strong> died of a suspected overdose at the age of 21. One minute of silence for a troubled kid definitely talented, whose expression of pain and sickness managed to reach a lot of people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prison, feud, death, just another week in the rap game. What about the music in all this ? Here is a quick feedback on everything that caught my hears these last days.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">DRAM - Crumbs (feat. Playboi Carti)</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UpEIsEkFuuQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eager to confirm a blazing year 2016, <strong>DRAM</strong> is building a new momentum with a serie of carefully chosen features. After <strong>Trippie Redd</strong> and <strong>Smokepurpp</strong> (just to cite those two), and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/dram-and-neil-young-announce-new-song-together/" target="_blank">before a collab with Neil Young</a> that I expect to be epic, he connects with <strong>Playboi Carti</strong> on <i>Crumbs</i>. It&rsquo;s a low key track, backed by enigmatic choirs, where DRAM&rsquo;s wacky tone sounds as familiar as ever. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I came for.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Nef The Pharaoh - Poppin Again</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FbgzX6wiPX0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alongside rappers like <strong>Mozzy</strong> or <strong>OMB Peezy</strong>, <strong>Nef The Pharaoh</strong> represents the new breed of the Bay Area. His recent feature on <strong>Too $hort</strong>&rsquo;s excellent mixtape <em>Hella Disrespectful </em>(you can listen to it <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.45152/title.too-short-showcases-bay-area-talent-with-hella-disrespectful-mixtape" target="_blank">here</a>) proves it. On <em>Poppin Again</em>, the kid from Vallejo drops a tune with a BPM so high it should get a ticket for speeding. Some call it messy, I call it futurism.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Lar$$en, Ski Mask The Slump God &amp; Jay Critch - Wassup Wit The Bag</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wctsQlYaggs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 2017 flute trend is past, is it time for a violin comeback ? One thing for sure, this track goes hard af. I&rsquo;m not sure about the real value of <strong>Lar$$en</strong> yet, and there&rsquo;s no more doubts that <strong>Ski Mask</strong> became a lead artist in the soundcloud wave. So I&rsquo;ll have a quick word for <strong>Jay Critch</strong>. The Brooklyn born kid is part of a new generation of New York based rappers, like <strong>A Boogie wit da Hoodie</strong> or <strong>Don Q</strong>, that tries to bring a bit of lyricism back in the clubs, without sticking to the old recipes. It&rsquo;s exciting to see NYC finally bringing new heads to the table.</p>
<h2>Lophiile - Off Top (with Freddie Gibbs)</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBIj7NtKZjk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Freddie Gibbs</strong> excels when challenged to add his OG vibe to the work of producers with strong personalities, what he proved by collaborating with Madlib or Kaytranada. <strong>Lophiile</strong> is a young LA producer<strong>,</strong> with a long road ahead to make it in this big league, but his refreshing kind of chillstep track <em>Off Top</em> perfectly wraps up the explosive rhymes of the gifted emcee. Make sure to check more of his work on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lophiile" target="_blank">his soundcloud</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Dave East &amp; Lil Uzi Vert - Don't Try Me</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buMsiottU0w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the flood of <strong>Lil Uzi Vert</strong>&rsquo;s features this year, this collab with <strong>Dave East</strong> clearly stands out. The heavy, hypnotic production, and the contrasting personalities of the two rappers help create a memorable atmosphere. I&rsquo;m not saying I want a whole mixtape, but this duo works more than just fine.</p>
<h2>CyHi The Prynce, Travis Scott - I'm Fine</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tR-phzTb9mg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every rapper is a street hustler and a church preacher. <strong>CyHi The Prince</strong> tries to bring back together these two faces on his last album <em>No Dope on Sundays</em>. In the pure<strong> GOOD Music</strong> tradition, it is often grandiloquent, but the vibe is hard to resist. <em>I&rsquo;m Fine</em> with <strong>Travis Scott</strong> works as a great appetizer before diving more deeply into the album.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And that&rsquo;s all for this week. Have a good listening, and stay away from the hard drugs.</p>
