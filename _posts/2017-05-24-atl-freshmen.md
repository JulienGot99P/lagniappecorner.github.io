<p align="justfify">Summer is coming back and you got tired of the gloomy, falsely depressed vibe everybody seems to be high on these days? </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Hoodrich Pablo Juan</b> and <b>Danny Wolf</b> got more of that scorching Dirty South for you. “<i>Hoodwolf</i>“ gathers 11 tracks of plain repetitive anthems for young and hard-working entrepreneurs. Guarantee without auto-tune or catchy melody. You can almost smell the burning asphalt of Atlanta sidewalks.</p>
<p align="justfify">The duo’s alchemy recalls <b>Wacka Flocka</b> and <b>Lex Luger</b>, <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/05/danny-wolf-hoodrich-entertainment-interview/">a direct source of inspiration for Danny Wolf</a>, the 20 years old producer with a candid face.<br/></p><p>Trivia: Danny
was born in Mexico City and crossed the American border when he was 10. Until recently, he lived in Atlanta as an illegal immigrant. He entered <b>Hoodrich Entertenainment</b> as a PR intern, meanwhile working on his own productions. In only three years he made a hard reputation that allowed him to
work with old figures (<b>Migos</b>, <b>ILoveMakonnen</b>, <b>Ferg</b>) and newcomers (<b>Uzi</b>, <b>Lil Pump</b>, <b>Smokepurpp</b>). A name we'll here a lot in the future.<br/></p><p>You can stream
