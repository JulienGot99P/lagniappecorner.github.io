<p align="justify">Europe woke up to the smiling face of <b>Jeremy
Corbyn</b>, the leftist hero of the day. Looks like conservatism suffered
another defeat, defying the pessimistic projections of a continent falling apart
under the strikes of gloomy nationalists. Could it be that we are allowed to begin this summer
2017 with fresh confidence and
optimistic spirit?</p>
<p align="justify">Starting with listening to <b>Jay Prince</b>’s
last mixtape <i>Late Summers</i> won’t hurt. It’s filled with jazz chords, laid-back
ambient, and heartwarming lyrics. There’s even a little bit of sax. Like Jay said himself “<i><a href="https://twitter.com/jayprince/status/864148667447496705">it’s been a long winter</a></i>”.
Way too long man.</p>
