<p>Is Gucci Mane finally on his way to being the big star the world has been awaiting for ? That’s what you might think watching his recent performance on NPR tiny desk concert. East Atlanta Santa proved his ability to distribute shots of happiness like nobody else. </p><p>

Watch him rap “First Day Out,” “Waybach” and “Last Time”, with Zaytoven on the key, and make up your mind. I personally never felt that much inclination to hug a convicted felon, singing about selling crack. 

</p><p>This time it’s for good. Gucci is going for it all.
