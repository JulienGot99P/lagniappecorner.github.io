<p>Located on the heights of Paris suburb, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Mont-Val%C3%A9rien">Fort Mont-Valérien</a> weights on the capital with its painful memories. Between 1941 and 1944, this fortress was used by the Nazis as a prison and place of executions, where more than a thousand members of the resistance, from every origins and social classes, were shot down. </p><p>This heavy past is the setting of Nakk Mendosa’s last video, a remix of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwp89PtaUBA">Fianso’s “<i>Tout l'monde s'en fout”</i></a>.</p><p>Along the side of his daughter, Nakk reflects on the the difficulty to stand up for his ideals, as a responsible adult and father. </p><p>On the ground of tragic events, the video is a short moment of breathing, so welcomed in a time of exhausting quarrels.</p>
