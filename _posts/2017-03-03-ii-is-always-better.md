<p align="justify">If you were a young movie-fan in the 90’s, with a peculiar taste for action flicks, then <b>Shane Black</b> was your man.
From <i>Lethal Weapon 2 </i>to <i>Last Action Hero,</i> the genius screenwriter laid with stories made of moral codes, chivalrous
attitudes, and cool punch lines, the foundation of
the grown up I would become. I can’t say it went *that* well, but still.</p>
<p align="justify">Buddy films were Black’s
signature. Movies about how to overcome differences, which is by the way a much more satisfying spectacle, than, let’s
say, big robots destroying random buildings. Recently his fantastic
<i>The Nice Guys</i> proved
that the genre was still relevant. Even more: necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">In Black’s filmography, <i>The Last
Boyscout</i> remains my favorite movie to this date. It contains hundreds of cult dialogues. Let’s
take this scene where <b>Bruce Willis</b>, playing
Joe Hallenbeck, finds himself in a dark alley with a gun pointed at his head. The
dialogue goes like this : </p><blockquote><p>

<i>Alley Thug</i>: Wrong place,
wrong time. Nothing personal. </p><p>

<i>Joe Hallenbeck</i>: That’s what you think. Last night I fucked your wife. </p><p>

<i>Alley Thug</i>: Oh you did, hah?
How’d you know it was my wife? </p><p>

<i>Joe Hallenbeck</i>: She said her husband was a big pimp lookin’ motherfucker with a hat. </p><p>

<i>Alley Thug</i>: Oh, you’re real
cool for somebody who’s about to take a bullet. </p><p>

<i>Joe Hallenbeck</i>: After fucking your wife I’ll take two. </p></blockquote><p>
The joke kills the thug. Literally. </p>
<p align="justify">To get out of a dangerous situation in a buddy film, it’s all about the wit. You need to talk
slick, and talk fast. </p>
<p align="justify">According to <a href="http://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjle6utLrSAhUBfxoKHUZACb4QFggaMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F9627497-the-big-payback&amp;usg=AFQjCNFy30XSXAm4IzgyGE7ssVHbES6d3A&amp;bvm=bv.148747831,d.d2s">Dan Charnas</a>, 
this attitude is at the source of rapping. No wonder rap music makes such a fitting format for perpetuating buddy films spirit. <b>Outkast</b>, <b>Starlito &amp; Don Trip</b>, <b>Run the Jewels</b>, exemples of duos working on this dynamic are numerous. </p>
<p align="justify">Last year, coming straight from Bruxelles, 
<b>Caballero &amp; JeanJass</b> offered
with <i>Double Hélice </i>their own successful equation. Its sequel is now eagerly awaited. Their last track is a classical ego trip (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jLT7GQYNhI">and a tribute to Birdman</a>) that foreshadows a <i>Double
Hélice 2</i> even better than the first one.</p>
<p align="justify">As every 90’s action flick fans know, the second episode is always the best.</p>
