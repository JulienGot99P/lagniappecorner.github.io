<p align="justify">Japanese Edo period saw the disintegration of the feudal system. At that time, masterless samurais refusing to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku">seppuku</a>, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C5%8Dnin">ronins</a>, were forced to hide. Many of them, to survive, joined groups of itinerant preachers called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komus%C5%8D">komusos</a>, famous for hiding their face with a basket.
