<p>I don&rsquo;t quite remember how I ended up watching the video clip of this baked kid mumbling about suicide over a midi song. I probably just liked the anime
background, before the heady melody got stuck into my brain. Ever since, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXVVZ9yuH3Is0J2_OwiH6ag"><b>YouTube channel
ASTARI</b></a> has been a bottom less pit of gems. I dive back into it every time I feel confident enough to endure the distress, partly because of misplaced curiosity, and partly to challenge my own
sanity.</p><p>If emo trap was a cult, then ASTARI would be its sanctuary. Its preachers
would be named <b>ITSOKTOCRY</b>, <b>Lil Lotus, Night Lovell</b> and <b>OmenXIII</b>, chanting canticles like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShI6axFfqj4"><i>Murder
me slowly</i></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGiSIyklJyc"><i>idk how to kill myself</i></a>, <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gv9dTDWqI">Run Home</a> </i>or <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjTJe8yOMfE">Drop Dead</a></i>.</p><p>Have a glance at their work, and you might quickly be convinced that each one of those kids is about to shoot up the
school. But I remember a time when <b><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26328105">playing Dungeon &amp; Dragons</a></b> and
listening to heavy metal characterized me as a sociopath. If growing old means to regard new generations’ creativity as a threat, I’d rather just stay the immature person I am.</p><p>In
a world where social medias feed peer pressure and generate new forms of depression, ASTARI is a priceless refuge for misfits. Like<b> </b><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624"><b>Marylin Manson said</b>
</a> in his days :</p><blockquote><p>It is no wonder that kids are growing up
more cynical; they have a lot of information in front of them. They can see
that they are living in a world that&rsquo;s made of bullshit. In the past, there was
always the idea that you could turn and run and start something better. But now
America has become one big mall, and because of the Internet and all of the
technology we have, there&rsquo;s nowhere to run. People are the same everywhere.
Sometimes music, movies and books are the only things that let us feel like
someone else feels like we do. I&rsquo;ve always tried to let people know it&rsquo;s OK, or
better, if you don&rsquo;t fit into the program. Use your imagination – if some geck
from Ohio can become something, why can&rsquo;t anyone else with the willpower and
creativity?</p></blockquote><p>You can follow the links below to enter this weird and kind of beautiful dimension:</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/daemonastari">https://www.instagram.com/daemonastari</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/astari">https://twitter.com/astari</a></p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/astvri">https://soundcloud.com/astvri</a></p><p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/astvri">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/astvri</a></p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQFfEneG_pIo"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFfEneG_pIo?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>
