<p align="justify">So Jay-Z got a himself a platinum certification. In a week (*insert dubious emoji*).</p>
<p align="justify">How comes that “4:44”, an album exclusive to TIDAL, managed to get a platinum certifications (meaning, a million sells) within a week, when it took two months to Beyonce’s “Lemonade” to reach it ? </p>
<p align="justify">RIAA, the association in charge of the certification, <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdjbooth.net%2Fnews%2Fentry%2F2017-07-05-jay-z-444-platinum&amp;t=MjA4MTljZGQzNDcwYzg3MjE0ZTI0NWE4ZjM3NGM4MmVjYWQyZDI3MixiZU9qSEpaUw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ABUTk06Wa4o6S6Y1kypuDSQ&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Flagniappecorner.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F162643910718%2Fcertifications-and-nebulous-schemes&amp;m=1">explained to DJBooth</a> : “Under the program’s rules, the artist needs to be compensated and there needs to be demonstrated consumer demand in the United States, either for an on-demand stream or a sale. A sale counts toward a certification if purchased directly by the customer or a business can purchase the album or song and offer it to fans who must take affirmative steps to acquire the album or song. Fans participated, took action and downloaded JAY-Z’s album offered by SPRINT.”<br/></p><p>Summarizing : SPRINT bought 1.000.000 copies and gave them for free, each user download being acccounted for as a sell by the RIAA. The reason why they did so ? SPRINT CORPORATION acquired 33% of TIDAL’s shares in early 2017.</p>
<p align="justify">So basically, Jay-Z self-certified an album that nobody listened to, or even really cared about, just to promote a streaming service that nobody really uses. </p><p>Meanwhile, TIDAL is threatening to sue Kanye West for breach of contract if he ever promotes his work on another streaming platform. Just to remember, “The Life Of Pablo” was a TIDAL exclusive for two months, when “4:44″ exclusivity ended after one week.</p>
<p align="justify">I mean. Hov, come on. Just stop. It’s gone.</p>
<p align="justify">And leave Kanye out of this mess.</p>
