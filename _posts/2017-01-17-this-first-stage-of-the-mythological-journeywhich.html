<p>This first stage of the mythological journey—which we have
designated the &ldquo;call to adventure&rdquo; —signifies that destiny has
summoned the hero and transferred his spiritual center of gravity
from within the pale of his society to a zone unknown. This
fateful region of both treasure and danger may be variously represented:
as a distant land, a forest, a kingdom underground,
beneath the waves, or above the sky, a secret island, lofty mountaintop,
or profound dream state; but it is always a place of
strangely fluid and polymorphous beings, unimaginable torments,
superhuman deeds, and impossible delight. The hero can
go forth of his own volition to accomplish the adventure, as did
Theseus when he arrived in his father&rsquo;s city, Athens, and heard
the horrible history of the Minotaur; or he may be carried or
sent abroad by some benign or malignant agent, as was
Odysseus, driven about the Mediterranean by the winds of the
angered god, Poseidon. The adventure may begin as a mere
blunder, as did that of the princess of the fairy tale; or still
again, one may be only casually strolling, when some passing phenomenon catches the wandering eye and lures one away
from the frequented paths of man. </p></blockquote><p><i> The hero with a thousand faces</i>, Joseph Campbell</p>
