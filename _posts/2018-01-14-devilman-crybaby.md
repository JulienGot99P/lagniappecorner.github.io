<p style="text-align: justify;">The last adaptation of the 1970s manga&nbsp;<em>Devilman&nbsp;</em>has been on Netflix for only a few days, so it&rsquo;s probably too early to know if it will have the same impact as&nbsp;<strong>Go Nagai</strong>&rsquo;s original work. For an anime fan, bored with a shonen genre paradoxically very pusillanimous, this new show already looks like a goddamn revolution. Not only the audacious visuals (work of<strong>&nbsp;Masaaki Yuasa</strong>) and storyline (by<strong>&nbsp;Ichirō Ōkouchi</strong>) are a kick in the ass of traditional shonens, it also resurrects the spirit of social criticism and sexual liberation that made the original manga famous. Be ready for scenes of masturbation, hetero and homosexual intercourses, and plenty of other fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The soundtrack plays a large part in this overall impression of boldness. Only a few seconds of the opening is enough to realize it : no catchy J-rock anthem here (a compulsory requirement for anime openings since pretty much forever), but an electrifying synthwave track that perfectly gives the tuning for the orgy about to happen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This unique vibe is the work of&nbsp;<strong>Ushio Kensuke</strong>, who describes himself as a &ldquo;<em>typical hikikomori bedroom music producer,</em>&rdquo; inspired by the Musique Concrète of&nbsp;<strong>Luc Ferrari</strong> and the art of&nbsp;<strong>Joseph Kosuth</strong>. Uchio, who also composes electronic music under the alias of&nbsp;<strong>agraph</strong>, entered the anime world by working on the score of&nbsp;<em>Koe no katachi</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>The Silent Voice</em>, that allowed him to experiment on screen his highly conceptual vision of music.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On&nbsp;<strong>Devilman Crybaby</strong>, Uchio creates a baroque soundtrack loaded with life and energy, wether in the form of a piano sonata (&ldquo;<em>His Heart</em>&rdquo;), EDM (&ldquo;<em>Night Ride</em>&rdquo;) or Chillstep (&ldquo;<em>School Life</em>&rdquo;). Most of all, the soundtrack is memorable for its synthwave touch (&ldquo;<em>Buddy Ryo</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>Akira the wild</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Strategist</em>&rdquo;), that carries the tension of the show, as well as the internal struggle of the hero, half human and half demon, always on the verge of exploding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The &ldquo;synthwave&rdquo; is a retrofuturistic movement that started around 2010, following the work of&nbsp;<strong>David Grellier&nbsp;</strong>(aka &ldquo;<strong>College</strong>&rdquo;), and later artists like&nbsp;<strong>Perturbator</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Power Glove</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Carpenter Brut</strong>. They all recognize to be heavily inspired by the design of the 1988 movie&nbsp;<em>Akira</em> - the breakthrough of japanese animation in the West, and the revelation that a manga could be adult and anti-establishment. All of this was made possible thanks to a punk revolution initiated in Japan by Go Nagai and his&nbsp;<em>Devilman</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In early 2018, a new devil has arised. Let&rsquo;s find out how much trouble this one will cause.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plus</strong> : If you like the whole synthwave trend, make sure to check the indie game&nbsp;<strong>Furi</strong>, developed by The Game Bakers (a Nintendo Switch version has just been announced). It&rsquo;s visually stunning, and the soundtrack gather all the figureheads of the genre. You can stream it below, or buy the album on bandcamp&nbsp;<a href="https://furi.bandcamp.com/">here</a>.</p>
