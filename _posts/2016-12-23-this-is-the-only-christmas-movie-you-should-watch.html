Let me talk about the spirit of christmas. The big day is tomorrow, and you are sitting in the train supposed to bring your ass back to your childhood home. Your hometown is probably nicely decorated with all sorts of lights honoring the birth of some child you don’t remember the name, and a fat Coca Cola emissary. You smile, dreaming of your mother’s delicious food, and the gifts you will soon open.<p><br/>Oh sure, 2016 wasn’t great. First of all, David Bowie died, which instantly makes this year a failure. And to make it worst, violent nationalisms are rising all over the world. Dictators and bullies are set loose. Democracies are consuming themselves in hate speeches and religious quarels, while 1% of the world population, owning as much wealth as the rest of the world combined, enjoy their mojitos under the tropics. </p><p> 
<br/>Of course, you are not responsible for this. That’s not what you want, because you are a good person.</p><p><br/>Are you ? Am I ? 

Weirldy enough, that’s the question that keeps poping to my head since I saw <i>What Would Jesus Buy?</i> A crazy documentary my girlfriend forced me to watch after a party involving too much alcohol. </p><p><br/>It’s about Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping, and their quest about bringing down the evils of consumerism and advertising. And it’s the only movie you should be watching for Christmas this year. </p><p>Let the truth convince you.
